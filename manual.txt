Welcome to Tommy and John's Lab5!

aside from lab4 commands, we implememted session invite and private messaging 
feature.

to invite others to a session, you must be in a session first(join or create a
session). The command format is:
/invite {username you want to invite}

once you are invited, you can accept or reject the invite by typing these commands:
/accept
/reject

if you accept, you will join the invitor's session, if you reject, you will remain in 
your previous session or stay in logged in status.

for private messaging, you need to log in first. Then , whether you are in session
or not, you can private message others as long as they are logged in.
private message use the following command:
/pm {username to talk to} {message}


The session invite has the following structure: 
there is a new packet type called session invite. When user send this packet to 
server, it contains the invitin username and invited username. The server extracts 
session ID of the invitor and the sockfd of the invited, and send the sessionID and the
invitor's username to the invited.the Invited user then store these two pieces of info locally.
when accepting the invitation, the invited uses the joinsession functionality with the 
stored sessionID, which we modified to notify everyone in the session when somebody joins. 
If reject, the invited will generate a private message to the Invitor to notify the 
rejection. 
After each accept or reject, the invitor username and sessionID that are stored locally
will be erased. to prevent multiple accept or reject.



The private messaging has the following structure:
The sender will deliver the target username and sender username integrated with the 
message in the packet to the server. Since server is required to forward the message, 
it extracts the target's sockfd and send the data over, which contains the sender username 
and the message.
